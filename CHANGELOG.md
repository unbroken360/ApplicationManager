## [0.11.0] - 2025-08-07

### âœ¨ Added

- Detection script template system: uses `Files\DetectionScriptWingetTemplate.ps1` with `<APPID>` and `<APPVERSION>` placeholders.
- Version-aware detection: compares installed version using `[Version]` and `-ge` operator.
- Automatic generation of detection script files per app (`SupportFiles\Detect-<AppID>.ps1`).
- Support for `_install.bat` and `_uninstall.bat`: automatically used as install/uninstall commands if present in the app folder.
- Smart `ServiceUI` wrapping: automatically applied **only if** install/uninstall is **not** a `.bat` file, prioritizing `ServiceUI_x64.exe`.

### ðŸ›  Fixed

- Resolved `Rename-Item` exceptions when `.intunewin` file already exists.
- Fixed issue where ServiceUI command line was broken due to multiple matches (e.g., both x64 and x86).

### ðŸ§¼ Improved

- PSADT template copying logic: now safely skips existing items and handles subfolders cleanly.
- Improved detection command generation and script validation.
- Clearer log messages for detection, copy, rename, and error handling.
